# A Simple Keylogger in Python

A keylogger, sometimes called a keystroke logger or keyboard capture, is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke
on a specific computer. Keylogger software is also available for use on smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone and Android devices.

Being a beginner I've built a basic Keylogger with the help of python which records the key pressed in the key board in a txt file.
